recipe-combinator-main=Complex combinator with a 6-tick latency.  Gives information about items and recipes.\n\nThe combinator can only show information about one recipe or one item.  It chooses which recipe according to its input settings:\n • If recipe signals are enabled as input, it can choose an input recipe signal.\n • If product signals are enabled as input, it can choose a recipe that produces a product listed in the input signals.\n • If ingredients are enabled as input, it can choose a recipe that consumes something indicated in an input signal.\nOnly recipes craftable by the given machines will be shown, with priority given according to machines on the left\n\nIf quality is active in the game, then Recipe Combinators take it into account.\n\nRecipe combinators do not currently support fractional products.\n\nThe output signals aren't shown in the info window (engine limitation).
recipe-combinator-spoilage-mechanic=Select this in the recipe combinator interface to give spoilage information.\n\nSince spoilage is not a recipe, you won't get any recipe signals as output.  The "output all recipes" feature outputs the ingredients instead.\n\nHigher-quality items take longer to spoil.  The combinator currently doesn't take this into account.
