# TODO

* Quality indicator: output a signal "Q" or so whose quality is set to the recipe quality, for downstream use
* Undo / redo support
* Update on mod config reload
* Update on techs researched ("if unlocked" and if tech unlocks recipes only)
* Graceful upgrade with "defunct" combinators
* Copy / paste items support
* Spoilage support
* Make "show all recipes" exclusive with other options
* Multiply and negate support
* Separate red/green output support??
* Right-alias support
* Test test test
* Test again with no quality

Py support
* Test in py
* Make a "commit" button for py, for perf reasons
* Update on py TURD selected or similar

Speculative future features
* Deal with probabilities
* Deal with productivity bonuses (either inherent in the machine or with modules)
* Better graphics
* Export to vanilla combinator array
* Constant combinators (list all fluids/items/recipes/recipes for certain machines/...)
* Some kind of matrix optimizer (e.g. if one column dominates another, then add an alias)
