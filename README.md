# Recipe combinator

This mod is mostly for people who want to make automatic malls.  It adds a new type of combinator which gives information about recipes.

Features:

* You can select which machines you are controlling.  These have priority, for example to prefer foundries instead of furnaces.
* Output recipe ingredients, products, and crafting time.
* Output which machine should craft the recipe.
* Output which modules are supported by that machine/recipe.
* Outputs can be on red or green wires, and can be optionally negated or multiplied by the input.
* Supports quality.
* Partially supports getting info on spoilage time and products.
