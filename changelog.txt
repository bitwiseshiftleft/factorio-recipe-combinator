  Oh, there is Even Picker Dollies for 2.0, thanks @arighteousgod.
  Restored and fixed the code so that Recipe Combinators can't be dollied.
  (Maybe eventually, but for now it's not supported because of all the subentities)

  Remove disable_picker_dollies.lua.  There's no picker dollies for 2.0 anyway.

  Public release.  Let me know what should be changed.

Version: 0.1.1

  Even more GUI options!  It should have a dropdown, but it doesn't.

  When given an item, the "multiply" flag divides by input/output quantity, rounding up
  Can multiply "show all recipes" output
  Input is split between items and fluids
  Can output just the quantity of the selected signal (so that you can immediately multiply)
  Fix a crash when placing a blueprint with no entities
  Fix a bug where "output selected signal" strips the quality

Version: 0.1

  Initial testing release.
  Can create recipe combinators, which are reskinned arithmetic combinators.
  The GUI probably exposes too many optional and allows you to select them all at once.
